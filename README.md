# ModernUIAnimation

An approach to provide relatively generic animations for WPF applications.




KNOWN ISSUES:
- see project issues


New features to come:

- determine what is more efficient: BiQuadratic or ExponentialEase and use whatever is more performant as default value
- provide a parameter that sets the animation times for both animations (in and out)
- provide either opacity change or opacity change and transition as modes to choose from*








*  = I don't know if that's a good way to describe the desired effects in xaml, but we'll see.
